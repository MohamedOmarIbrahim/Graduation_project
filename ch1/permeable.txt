
1. **Real-Time Interaction:** A chatbot designed for medical emergencies should be capable of providing real-time interaction to address urgent situations promptly.

2. **Permeable Interaction:** This term is not standard in the field of chatbots, but I assume it might mean seamless or flexible interaction. A good emergency medical chatbot should be able to adapt to various user inputs and provide relevant assistance.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Advanced natural language processing capabilities are essential for understanding and responding to user inputs accurately.

4. **Integration with Medical Databases:** To provide accurate and up-to-date information, the chatbot should be integrated with medical databases, ensuring that it can access the latest medical knowledge.

5. **Emergency Protocols:** The chatbot should be programmed with emergency protocols and guidelines to assist users in critical situations. This might include guiding users through CPR, providing information on common emergency scenarios, and advising on when to seek professional medical help.

6. **User Authentication and Privacy:** Given the sensitive nature of medical information, the chatbot should incorporate robust user authentication and privacy measures to ensure the confidentiality of user data.

7. **Multilingual Support:** To cater to a diverse user base, multilingual support is crucial, especially in emergency situations where users might not be fluent in a particular language.

8. **Integration with Emergency Services:** In some cases, it might be beneficial for the chatbot to have the ability to connect users with emergency services directly if necessary.
